# streamsum

Configuration-driven summarization of a stream of events into a pluggable kv store.

## Overview

There are three stages of data transformation.

1. An event object is destructured into a tuple
2. A tuple is transformed into zero or more tuples.  The "predicate" of the tuple is mapped to a cache id.
3. Cache-mapped tuples are recorded into caches

```
            +-------+                +---------+                      +-------+
[Event] --> |extract| --[p s o t]--> |transform| --[cacheid s o t]*-> |record |-->[cacheid, key, value, t]
            +-------+                +---------+                      +-------+
```

#### Events
Events are arbitrary structures.  A destructuring function must be provided to map Event structures into tuples.

#### Tuples
Tuples are 4-tuples of the form [predicate subject object time], or [p s o t] for short.

#### Caches
Various types of caches are provided, and may be extended to additional types.  Three types of caches are provided by default

  * assoc -- simple kv mapping
  * lastn -- last N values are retained per key
  * count -- each occurrence of a [pred subj obj] is counted, and the most recent time is retained


#### Cache mapping
Each tuple emitted from the `transform` stage has a cache key in its first field.  In the `record` stage, these cache-mapped tuples are aggregated into caches based on the value of this key.

#### Cache store
An implementation of `CacheServer` may be provided.  This protocol has a single `getMap` function which takes a cache name and returns a mutable `java.util.Map`.  In typical usage, the cache server is an interface between the summarizer and application code which consumes the summarized data from the caches.

The default cache server creates in-memory `java.util.HashMap` instances for caches.

## Configuration

The system is configured with an [EDN](http://edn-format.org/) map, typically read from a file path.
See [config.edn](example/streamsum/config.edn) for an example.

### Event destructuring

The `Extract` protocol provides a single `extract` function which produces a sequence of zero or more 4-tuples from an `Object` implementing `Extract`.  Tuples are of the form `[p s o t]`,  predicate (action), subject, object, time.

To extract an arbitrary type, extend the `Extract` protocol to that type.  By default vectors implement `Extract` as a pass-through.

### Transformation

Tuple transformations are specified as a sequence of patterns in the syntax of core.match.  These map a `[p s o t]` 4-tuple to zero or more 4-tuples. The first element of each output tuple is treated as a key mapping the tuple to a specific cache.  For example,

```
 :tuple-transforms
 [
  [[CREATE_CHAT user thread time]] [[:create-thread-user thread user time]
                                    [:post-user-thread user thread time]]
               
  [[REPLY_CHAT user thread time]]  [[:post-user-thread user thread time]]
               
  [[CREATE_DOC user doc time]]     [[:upload-doc-user doc user time]
                                    [:upload-user-doc user doc time]]

  [[ANNOTATE_DOC user doc time]]   [[:annotate-user-doc user doc time]]
 ]
```

### Cache mapping
Cache configuration is a map of the form `{cache-key [cache-type description]}`, `cache-key` is the name of the cache in keyword form and `cache-type` is one of the three supported types `:associative` `:lastn` `:count`.  For example, 

```
:cache-config
{:create-thread-user [:associative "creator of each top-level chat (a.k.a. thread)"]
   :post-user-thread [:lastn "last N threads to which a user posted"]
   :upload-doc-user [:associative "original uploader of each document"]
   :upload-user-doc [:lastn "last N documents which a user uploaded"]
   :annotate-user-doc [:lastn "last N documents which a user annotated"]
   }
```



### Extending cache types

## Usage
`streamsum` is intended to be a self-contained subsystem, not a library.  It uses `com.stuartsierra.component` to manage lifecycle.  It spawns threads to do its processing.

Instantiate a new `streamsum` system passing a path to the config file or a configuration map, an input `BlockingQueue` and an output `BlockingQueue`, and a `CacheServer` instance.  Use `component/start` and `component/stop` to control the system lifecycle.

TODO: include `CacheServer` instance.

```
(def streamsum 
        (let [config-path "example/streamsum/config.edn"
              in-q (ArrayBlockingQueue. 20)
              out-q (ArrayBlockingQueue. 20)
              cache-server (caches/default-cache-server)]
          (-> (new-streamsum config-path in-q out-q cache-server)
              component/start)))
```

The client application puts events on the input queue and consumes cache update tuples from the output queue.  The client app may choose to log the cache update tuples for backup purposes.  The tuples must be consumed off the output queue to avoid blocking the processing pipeline.  The client app reads the summarized data from the `CacheServer`'s caches.
